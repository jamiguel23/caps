## Lab 11

Today, we begin the first of a 4-Phase build of the CAPS system, written in Node.js. In this first phase, our goal is to setup a system of events and handlers, with the intent being to change out the eventing system as we go, but keeping the handlers themselves largely the same. The task of “delivering a package” doesn’t change (the handler), even if the mechanism for triggering that task (the event) does.

The following user/developer stories detail the major functionality for this phase of the project.

As a vendor, I want to alert the system when I have a package to be picked up.
As a driver, I want to be notified when there is a package to be delivered.
As a driver, I want to alert the system when I have picked up a package and it is in transit.
As a driver, I want to alert the system when a package has been delivered.
As a vendor, I want to be notified when my package has been delivered.
And as developers, here are some of the development stories that are relevant to the above.

As a developer, I want to use industry standards for managing the state of each package.
As a developer, I want to create an event driven system so that I can write code that happens in response to events, in real time.
